## Ukagaka Dream Team

A repository for projects by the Ukagaka Dream Team. We make English Ukagaka stuff, and help organize resources to make Ukagaka dev available to more folks. If you're interested, check out our [Tumblr](https://ukagakadreamteam.tumblr.com/), and our [Discord server](https://ukagakadreamteam.tumblr.com/discord) linked from there.

This organization currently exists to host the English translation of Ukadoc that we're working on. Perhaps there will be more in the future, perhaps not!
